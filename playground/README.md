- Node 14
  - [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage installed Node versions
- React Native CLI
  - `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`
- Xcode

## üìù Creating Stories

Stories exist in `storybook/stories/` and filenames should be appended with `.stories.tsx`. All new stories should be within the `/stories` directory.

Unlike in the web version of Storybook, new stories are not automatically added to Storybook. To add newly created stories to Storybook, run `yarn prestorybook`.

## üìö Running the On Device Storybook üì±

To run the on device version of Storybook, simply build and launch the React Native application using
`yarn ios` or `yarn android`

You may run a Storybook web server in tandem with your on device storybook with `yarn storybook:server`

## üìö Building the Web Storybook üñ•Ô∏è

The playground's RN stories can be converted to React Native Web and displayed in the traditional web-based Storybook interface. Currently, this is can only be built and served statically.

To build Storybook web, run `yarn storybook:web:build`

Once you have built Storybook web, you can launch it locally with `yarn storybook:web:run`
